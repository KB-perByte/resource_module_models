      - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
      - The value of this option should be the output received from the EOS device by
        executing the command B(show running-config | section ntp).
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
        transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
        and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
